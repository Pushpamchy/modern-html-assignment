Here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

1. Use Semantic HTML: Semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` provide a clear document structure. Use them appropriately to convey the meaning and hierarchy of your content to assistive technologies and users.

2. Provide Alt Text for Images: Include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images using the `alt` attribute in `<img>` tags. Alt text helps users with visual impairments understand the content and purpose of images.

3. Create Keyboard-Friendly Interfaces: Ensure that all interactive elements, such as links, buttons, and form controls, are navigable and usable using a keyboard alone. Use the `tabindex` attribute to specify the order of focusable elements and test keyboard navigation thoroughly.
