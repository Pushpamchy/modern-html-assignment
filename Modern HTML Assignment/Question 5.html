            <h2>Feature1: Audio & Video</h2>
            <p> HTML5 introduced the `audio` and `video` elements, allowing developers to embed audio and video content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.This native support simplifies multimedia integration and enhances the user experience. It ensures cross-browser compatibility and reduces reliance on outdated plugins, making web content more accessible.
            </p>

        <section id="Feature2">
                <h2>Feature2: Canvas For Graphics</h2>
                <p> HTML5 includes the `canvas` element, which provides a dynamic, scriptable rendering surface for graphics, animations, and interactive applications using JavaScript. The canvas element is ideal for creating games, data visualizations, and interactive content. Developers can draw shapes, images, and manipulate pixels directly in the browser, resulting in rich and engaging web experiences.</p>
            </section>
            <Section id="Feature3">
                <h2>Feature3: Local storage</h2>
                <p> HTML5 introduced Web Storage, comprising `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, which allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device. LocalStorage` is suitable for storing larger amounts of data, such as user preferences and application settings, persistently across sessions. `sessionStorage` is used for temporary, session-specific data storage. These features enable web apps to work offline and provide responsive and efficient user experiences.</p>
            </Section id="Feature4">
            <h2>Feature4: WebSockets</h2>
            <p>HTML5 includes the WebSocket API, enabling real-time, full-duplex communication between a web server and a client's browser. WebSockets facilitate instant data exchange, making them valuable for applications like online gaming, chat systems, and collaborative tools. They maintain open connections, allowing for low-latency communication without the overhead of traditional HTTP requests and responses. This feature enhances the real-time capabilities of web applications. </p>
